# [The Use of NLP and DLT to Enable the Digitalization of Telecom Roaming Agreements](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Project+Plan%3A+The+Use+of+NLP+and+DLT+to+Enable+the+Digitalization+of+Telecom+Roaming+Agreements)

## Set up ðŸ™‚
1. Create environmental variables file based on .env.example (~/NLP-DLT/network)
2. Obtain access keys from AWS E.g.:
    <img src="https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/images/accessKey.png" width="790" height="350">
    - Update the environment variable AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    - Update the environment variable AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    - Update the environment variable AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
    - Updating path of pdf file
    - Updating path of JSON file

## How to use ðŸ˜Ž
1. Clone repository
2. cd ~/NLP-DLT/network
3. Start: docker-compose up -d
4. Stop: docker-compose stop
5. Down: docker-compose down

## NLP Engine Stage
The documentation of this stage can be found in:
- [Documentation of NLP stage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1koele3CqJVgkUA9-LVAs5eLdc01ZQYak/view?usp=sharing)

This stage include two outputs: 
- Roaming Agreement Output Template (RAOT) determined by NLP engine
- Manual Measurement of the NLP Engine Accuracy

### RAOT NLP Engine
1. cd ~/NLP-DLT/nlp/output
2. more ./[Roamming Agreements Output Template.json](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/nlp/data/output/Roaming%20Agreements%20Output%20Template.json)

### Measurement of Accuracy
- The [text comparison tool](https://countwordsfree.com/comparetexts) was used manually to check the accuracy of the results. 
- For this purpose each of the sub-articles found in [Roamming Agreements Output Template.json](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/nlp/data/output/Roaming%20Agreements%20Output%20Template.json) are compared with the sub-articles of the PDFs found in the input folder (~/NLP-DLT/nlp/input).
- The spreadsheets corresponding to the two PDF files used as inputs have been generated:
    - [Determination of the accuracy of the NLP engine for the Proxymus Roaming Agreement.](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/nlp/data/accuracy/Accuracy%20Proxymus.xlsx?raw=true)
    - [Determination of the accuracy of the NLP engine for the Orange Roaming Agreement.](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/nlp/data/accuracy/Accuracy%20Orange.xlsx?raw=true)

## To do ðŸ¤”
1. Fix the code to correctly determine the organizations variables.
2. Fix heading detection when sub-articles are analized.
3. Perform the analysis one level down to go on the sentence level
4. Automate accuracy determination.
5. Hardcode of the default template.json file
6. Hardcode of list of articles.json file
7. Complete the documentation of the library
