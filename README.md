# [The Use of NLP and DLT to Enable the Digitalization of Telecom Roaming Agreements](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Project+Plan%3A+The+Use+of+NLP+and+DLT+to+Enable+the+Digitalization+of+Telecom+Roaming+Agreements)

## Set up ðŸ™‚
1. Clone the repository
2. Build a docker image:
    - `cd ~/NLP-DLT/nlp`
    - `docker build -t nlp-engine .`
3. To verify the docker image should be used the command `docker images`
    <img src="https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/images/dockerVerification.png">
3. Create an environmental variables file based on .env.example (~/NLP-DLT/network)
4. Obtain access keys from AWS E.g.:
    <img src="https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/images/accessKey.png">
    - Update the environment variable `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
    - Update the environment variable `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
    - Update the environment variable `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
    - Update the path of PDF files which contains Roaming Agreements
        - Default place: `~/NLP-DLT/nlp/input`
    - Update the path of JSON files
        - Default place: `~/NLP-DLT/nlp/output`

## How to use ðŸ˜Ž
1. `cd ~/NLP-DLT/network`
2. Start: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Stop: `docker-compose stop`
4. Down: `docker-compose down`

## NLP Engine Stage ðŸ’»
The documentation of this stage can be found in:
- [Documentation of NLP stage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1koele3CqJVgkUA9-LVAs5eLdc01ZQYak/view?usp=sharing)

This stage include two outputs: 
- Roaming Agreement Output Template (RAOT) determined by NLP engine
- Manual Measurement of the NLP Engine Accuracy

### RAOT NLP Engine
1. `cd ~/NLP-DLT/nlp/output`
2. `more ./Roamming Agreements Output Template.json`
    - Default example of Roaming Agreement: [Roamming Agreements Output Template.json](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/nlp/data/output/Roaming%20Agreements%20Output%20Template.json)

### Measurement of Accuracy
- The [text comparison tool](https://countwordsfree.com/comparetexts) was used manually to check the accuracy of the results. 
- For this purpose each of the sub-articles found in [Roamming Agreements Output Template.json](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/nlp/data/output/Roaming%20Agreements%20Output%20Template.json) are compared with the sub-articles of the PDFs found in the input folder (~/NLP-DLT/nlp/input).
- The spreadsheets corresponding to the two PDF files used as inputs have been generated:
    - [Determination of the accuracy of the NLP engine for the Proxymus Roaming Agreement.](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/nlp/data/accuracy/Accuracy%20Proxymus.xlsx?raw=true)
    - [Determination of the accuracy of the NLP engine for the Orange Roaming Agreement.](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/NLP-DLT/blob/main/nlp/data/accuracy/Accuracy%20Orange.xlsx?raw=true)

## Chaincode Design, Implementation and Testing Stage ðŸ’»

### RAOT NLP Engine
1. `cd ~/NLP-DLT/chaincode/design`
2. To open the file `diagram_sequence_chaincode.drawio` using [App Diagrams Tool](https://app.diagrams.net/)

## To do ðŸ¤”
1. Delete characters in sub-articles.
2. Fix heading detection when sub-articles are analized.
3. Hardcode of the default template.json file
4. Hardcode of list of articles.json file
5. Fix the code to correctly determine the organizations variables.
6. Determine the accuracy of the NLP engine to extract variables and variations 
7. Complete the documentation of the library
8. Perform the analysis one level down to go on the sentence level
    - There are two branches created: `main` and `sentencelvl`
        - To change to the branch `sentencelvl` use the command `git checkout sentencelvl`
9. Automate accuracy determination.
